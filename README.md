# Options Pricing: Black–Scholes & Monte Carlo

This project implements two fundamental methods to price European call and put options:

- **Black–Scholes Model:** An analytical formula that calculates the exact option price under assumptions of constant volatility and risk-free interest rate.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** A numerical method that estimates option price by simulating many possible future asset price paths and averaging discounted payoffs.

## Features

- Calculate European call and put option prices using both methods
- Visualize simulated distribution of asset prices at maturity
- Compare pricing results between Black–Scholes and Monte Carlo
- Demonstrate Monte Carlo convergence and variance reduction techniques (optional)
